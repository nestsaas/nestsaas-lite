    question: "How to diliver NestSaaS after purchase?",
    answer:
      "The NestSaaS is delivered via GitHub private repository. If you login with a GitHub account, after purchase, you will receive the collaborator invitation. After accepting the invitation, you will be able to access the repository and start building right away. If you are logged in with a different account, you can still purchase the NestSaaS and we will ask you to fill in your GitHub username at the Stripe checkout. If payment is successful, but no collaborator invitation is received, no worry, please contact us for assistance.",
